## Conclusion

The refactoring will provide significant performance improvements across the canvas system, with the most dramatic benefits in interactive elements like selection boxes and control points. While some components require major architectural changes, the overall system will be more performant, maintainable, and scalable.

The layered approach and strategic use of Flutter's optimization mechanisms (RepaintBoundary, ValueNotifier, CustomPainter) will transform the canvas from a monolithic rebuilding system to a highly optimized, component-based rendering pipeline.

Key success factors:

- Careful phase-by-phase implementation
- Comprehensive testing at each stage
- Performance monitoring throughout the process
- Maintaining backward compatibility where possible

The refactoring represents a significant investment that will pay dividends in user experience, maintainability, and future feature development capabilities.
